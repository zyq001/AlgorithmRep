 * Given a sequence {an}, how many non-empty sub-sequence of it is a prefix of fibonacci sequence.

 A sub-sequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

 The fibonacci sequence is defined as below:

 F1 = 1, F2 = 1

 Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2, n>=3
 * Created by root on 15-9-30.
